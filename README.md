Tic Tac Toe Project for CCSWEC

There will be two teams, one focused on game logic and creating the console output and another focused on implementing an AI or other player option. Participating members will be split equally between both teams. Both teams will have different roles and channels for proper tracking, but the two teams can communicate in each otherâ€™s channels.
Participants are encouraged to reach out to fellow members for assistance, and group collaboration sessions are highly encouraged. There will be voice channels provided for each team should more than one person wish to bounce ideas off one another on how to finish their tasks.
This project will run from December 1st to December 31st, If project is finished before the given deadline then another project will be started.
